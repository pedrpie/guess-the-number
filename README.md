# Guess the Number

A simple, friendly "Guess the Number" game — a small project to learn programming fundamentals (input/output, control flow, random numbers) or to have a quick, nostalgic CLI/browser game. This repository contains one or more implementations of the classic game where the player tries to guess a secret number chosen by the computer.
